In my first C programming class ever, we were only taught how to write code to make things work. There was no standard of how to write code. Everyones code looked different, which also made asking for help from others pretty difficult. Whenever I look back and try to decipher how the code works, upon first glance it hurts my eyes. My variables are random letters, white space is either everywhere or nowhere, and just line after line of inefficient code. It made me realize that I wasn't learning how the language worked, but rather I was just learning how to type in the language. 

## Coding Standards 

In my future ICS programming classes, coding standards are enforced. At first the idea seemed like it was forced upon us, but after getting accustomed to it for a while it made understanding code much easier. Everyone has a different style or syntax when writing code.

But in the end the goal in writing code is to write it so our classmates and colleagues can understand it practically on the fly. This is easily accomplished when everyone is using similar code standards. This is especially important in collaboration projects. Eliminating all format inconsisties allows each group member to understand code much easier. 

With ESlint and Intellij, it's just another coding standard that I have to learn.
