## Semantic UI

Enter <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, making the HTML/CSS world a better place. Ever tried to make a website with raw HTML/CSS? Thought it was impossible? Well not to worry, with Semantic UI's easy to implement features web designing becomes an absolute breeze. Check this out! You can turn your website from this

<img class="ui floated rounded image" src="../images/browsinghistory-before.png">

into this!

<img class="ui floated rounded image" src="../images/browsinghistory-after.png">

Just look at that top navigation bar! 

## 10/10 Would Tell A Friend

Now with that being said, I like it! I've had experience with HTML/CSS prior to this class, and I've already enjoyed the language. Web designing is a nice break from the usual C/Java programming languages that we mostly do. Semantic UI manages to make the experience much greater in my opinion. And since I knew the basics of HTML beforehand, understanding Semantic UI was pretty effortless. Class names are closer to English rather than having random strings of words. This makes designing feel natural; saving a lot of time and stress compared to raw HTML/CSS. For example, if you wanted a grid layout with Semantic UI the class would be something like "ui grid", and then the following column classes to determine how many columns you'd like. That is much easier than using the table tag in raw HTML. I do however have one gripe with Semantic UI when implementing CSS. With the Framework being fairly strict I've noticed some CSS elements I try to implement will not work. Also it is harder to specify exactly what element/tag you want to edit with all the div tags everywhere. That could just be me not fully understanding how CSS works with Semantic, but regardless the pros outweigh my cons. And in return, the end results of using the UI Framework are not disappointing.
