## Semantic UI

Enter <a href="http://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a>, making the HTML/CSS world a better place. Ever tried to make a website with raw HTML/CSS? Thought it was impossible? Well not to worry, with Semantic UI's easy to implement features web designing becomes an absolute breeze.

The end results of using the UI Framework are not disappointing. I don't even know how results like those Semantic UI is giving would be possible with raw HTML coding, but I'm sure it's possible.
