## A Celestrial Event

Meteor showers are a spectacle to see. Streak of lights brightening the night sky. A very enthusiastic celestial event for everyone to enjoy, from a distance that is. However if magically you were to fly into the path of the shooting star, getting closer and closer; well you could get burned. Similarly, when initally hearing about the <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor Framework</a> I was impressed about its features. Development in real-time, smart packages, and tons of integration, support, and features right out of the box. And then the Meteor started getting closer, or rather, I decided to take flight into its path. 

## And Then It Hit Me

I got burned ... out. There is definitely a learning curve when initally starting meteor, and boy that steep learning curve was real. It wasn't gonna be easy. I honestly hated it. But then, what is easy about learning something new anyway? When first learning Meteor, we were given simple assignments to do. Also screencasts and tutorials of how to do things were given as supplemental information. All the information however just seemed to not stick with me. I just found myself not being able to understand why certain steps were done to do a certain task. Adding to that, I'd often get lost while doing the assignments since there are so many files having the same filenames. Sometimes I'd accidentally edit the wrong file, causing a huge mess in the application, and adding more stress to solving unending errors that I'd have to debug through. The end product was cool though. A fully functional website that was created in real-time.

## Calm In The Storm

About two weeks into Meteor and many assignments later, I finally have a grasp of what is going on. I'm becoming comfortable using the framework.
