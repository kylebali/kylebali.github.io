## Configuration Management 101

Configuration Management is a useful tool for software engineers.  It is also something I wish I knew about earlier.  Where configuration management shines is situations where there is a large development team working on the same application.  Having an effective use of configuration management can allow for increased efficiency on managing and tracking multiple versions of these applications.  For example, team members can identify when changes are made, and their impacts on the entire project.

## Experiences

After thinking about all my group projects within my past ICS courses, I do believe that learning about configuration management sooner would have been beneficial for everyone.  It is a great and useful tool, and could have saved lots of time debugging.  I didn't have much problems with my group and our code, but there were a few moments where one moment the code works and the next time we tried it didn't.  Simple tracking of what happened to the code would have been nice there, as we didn't know what else to do except start over.

## What's more popular?  Git or GitHub?

Not sure how to answer this one.  I've only been recently introduced to both Git and Github.  To me they are two sides of the same coin.  Both different, yet both complementing each other.  Git is a version control system, which basically helps tracks changes when working with source code.  While GitHub is a web-page where Git repositories can be stored.  Perhaps Git is maybe a bit more popular since it can run stand-alone, and a little easier to use.
