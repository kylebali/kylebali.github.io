The basis of this project was to create a program that reads a script from a text file, to create an interactive story game.  My group decided to go with a "what if" story that has the character crash landed in a deserted isle.  We also decided to try make the game funny and challenging by adding multiple scenarios where the player ultimately loses and has to start over.  For extra credit, we added in a little mini-game where the player fights a wild boar.


For the creation of this project my group members and I first created the plot of how we wanted the story to go.  Once we figured out what we were doing the project on, we then had weekly meetings to create the code necessary to run the project.  I then found the necessary pictures and sounds for each part of the story, and we then compiled everything together.  After the hard work of debugging and the last minute addition of the boar game, we received an "A" for the project.
