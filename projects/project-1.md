This was an assignment for my ICS 111 (Intro to Computer Science) Class.  The class focused primarily on the Java language, and how to have fun programming in Java.  This first project was to make a playable musical instrument with sounds of our choosing.  

I throughly enjoyed this first project since I am musically inclined, and I like to jam on my Guitar or Piano when I have the chance.  I chose to make a classic piano.  I recorded the sounds of the instrument myself by playing on my keyboard and recording the audio on my computer, and also included both piano and vibraphone sounds.  The user interacts with the instrument by pressing keys on the computer keyboard.  The default sound is the piano, and can be switched to the vibraphone sounds by pressing the Caps Lock key on their keyboard. 

The project is written in Java with much help from the EZ graphics library created by Dylan Kobayashi.
