summary: A web application developed for ICS 314 that allow users to buy/sell concert tickets easily.   
---

Manoa TCKTS is an appplication that allows University of Hawaii students to buy/sell concert tickets. This application also allow students to sell and buy tickets at a more affordable price, compared to buying tickets from outside ticket vendors at retail price.

This is was a group project that I collaborated with a three others to complete. During the period, I was mostly tasked with creating the landing page, shown in the image below, so new users are able to understand what the application will bring. Also, I finalized the layouts of the pages to ensure that the app looks good, and assisted the other group members in creating the functionality of the application.

I learned a lot about organizational management, and working as a team through this project. It was a great experience completing this application.
