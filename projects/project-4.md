---

Manoa TCKTS is an appplication that allows University of Hawaii students to buy/sell concert tickets. This application also allow students to sell and buy tickets at a more affordable price, compared to buying tickets from outside ticket vendors at retail price. 

This is was a group project that I collaborated with a three others to complete. With the help of Javascript, HTML, and Semantic-UI we were able to bring this application to life. During the period, I was mostly tasked with creating the landing page so new users are able to understand what the application will bring. Additionally, while creating the landing page I included animations and transitions. Also, managing the issue creation and the project home page on github, finalizing the layouts of the pages to ensure that the app looks good, and assisting the other group members in creating the functionality of the application. I learned a lot about organizational management, and working as a team through this project. It was a great experience completing this application.
